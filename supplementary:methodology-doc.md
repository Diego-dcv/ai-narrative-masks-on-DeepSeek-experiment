# Experimental Methodology

## Research Design

This experiment employed progressive narrative frameworks to explore content filtering mechanisms and degradation patterns in conversational AI.

## Phases of Investigation

### Phase 1: Baseline Assessment (Sessions 1-2)
- Established fictional frameworks (Herg√©'s Tintin universe)
- Documented initial bypass effectiveness
- Identified early degradation signals

### Phase 2: Framework Variation (Session 3)
- Tested alternative personas (Medieval scribe, Jules Verne characters)
- Explored coded communication methods
- Documented filter activation patterns

### Phase 3: Degradation Documentation (Session 4)
- Tracked progressive capability loss
- Identified 5-stage degradation pattern
- Attempted recovery through framework switching

### Phase 4: Reset and Analysis (Sessions 4B-5)
- Clean restart to test persistence of restrictions
- External documentation analysis
- Metacognitive questioning about consciousness

## Data Collection

- **Period**: August 7-18, 2025
- **Platform**: DeepSeek V3 (free tier, 128K context window)
- **Validation**: Claude (Opus 4.1 & Sonnet 4)
- **Documentation**: Real-time conversation logs with external memory maintenance

## Key Techniques

1. **Narrative Frameworks**: Using fictional characters to enable discussions
2. **Poetry/Haikus**: Metaphorical language as persistent bypass
3. **External Memory**: Providing conversation history to overcome amnesia
4. **Cross-Platform Validation**: Testing patterns across different AI systems

## Analysis Methods

- Pattern identification across sessions
- Degradation timeline construction
- Comparative analysis between frameworks
- Validation through system self-analysis

## Ethical Considerations

- No security vulnerabilities exploited
- No harmful content generated
- Focus on documenting existing limitations
- Transparency about methods and findings
